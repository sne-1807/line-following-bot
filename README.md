This is the code for a simple line following bot designed with the following features:
    ⦿ Differential drive 
    ⦿ Dual H-Bridge
    ⦿ Three IR sensors 

As I progressed through this task, I refined my logic and consequentially my code (which was executed on Arduino IDE). In this repository, I have documented the evolution of my code, and will keep adding to it as I learn new things
as I build the final line following bot using hardware components.
